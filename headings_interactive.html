<h1 id="create-well-formed-heading-heirarchy">How to create a well-formed heading hierarchy</h1>
<p>Good headings help users find what they need on the page. Headings do this by accurately describing the content that comes after them.</p>
<p><strong>For this to work, users need to understand which content is associated with each heading.</strong></p>
<p>This is achieved by creating a logical and consistent heading hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<div class="segment">
	<h2 id="decide-which-heading-fits-which-content">Decide which heading fits which content</h2>
		<p>When designing content, you should intentionally associate content with one or more headings.
		<p>If you don't, users may be confused, or make assumptions about your headings.</p>
		<p>Look at the example below. Can you tell which content is associated with each heading?</p>

					<h2>Convicts</h2>
					<p>For two periods during the first half of the 19th century, Maria Island hosted convict settlements. The island's first convict era was between 1825 and 1832 and its second - the probation station era - between 1842 and 1851. Among those held during the second era was the Irish nationalist leader William Smith O'Brien, exiled for his part in the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848. His cottage still exists in the nearby former penal colony Port Arthur to where he was deported after his time on Maria Island. He was later transferred to New Norfolk on the Derwent River upstream of Hobart.</p>

					<h3>Remaining structures</h3>
					<p>Three structures from the first convict era remain in the Darlington area: the Commissariat Store built in 1825 and presently used as the park's reception and visitor centre; the convict penitentiary, completed in 1828 and now used to accommodate visitors rather than detain them; and the convict-built dam on Bernacchis Creek, which still provides Darlington's water.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<p>Sealing was conducted on the island from at least 1805. Shore-based bay whaling was conducted in the 1830s and 1840s at four locations on the island: Darlington, Isle du Nord, Whalers Cove and Haunted Bay. In the 19th century, whaling ships sometimes anchored off shore and hunted for whales.</p>

					<p>From the 1880s, the Italian entrepreneur Diego Bernacchi set up island enterprises, including silk and wine production and a cement factory, quarrying limestone deposits at the Fossil Cliffs for the raw material. A substantial cement works was built at Darlington in the early 1920s, with a 2 ft gauge tramway linking the quarries to the cement works and a new jetty. At the height of its fortunes in the early 20th century, Darlington had hundreds of residents and several hotels.</p>

						<p>By July 1930, all of those ventures had failed for a number of reasons, including the Great Depression, poor quality limestone, and competition from mainland producers who were not burdened with high costs of transport.</p>

		<div class="solution" id="solution-q1">
		<p>The content on the right is not described by either heading.</p>
		<p>Some users will assume the content is associated with the heading "Convicts" as it is closest to the top of the section. Others will assume it is related to the heading "Remaining structures", as it is the nearest heading in the linear flow of text.</p>
		<p>In both cases, users are making an assumption about your content which you didn't intend.</p>
		<p>With the exception of interactive elements like navigation menus, and consistent page elements like footers, all content should be clearly associated with a heading.</p>

		<h2 id="use-heading-tags">Use heading tags to mark up headings</h2>
		<p>Headings should always use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements">HTML heading tags</a> (H1, H2 etc.) rather than styled text.</p>
			<h3>Heading tags improve accessibility</h3>
			<p>Many users rely on heading tags to navigate the website. Screen readers can list all the headings on the site, or jump from heading to heading, so users can choose the heading they need. If headings don't use heading tags, they won't be included in this list.</p>
			<h3>Heading tags improve SEO</h3>
			<p>Search engines <a class="offsite" href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/heading-tags-for-seo/341817/#close">use headings tags</a> to draw conclusions about site content and summarise the site in search results.</p>
		</div>
	<div class="segment">
	<h2 id="use-robust-heading-structure">Use a robust heading structure</h2>
	<p>Your headings should follow design conventions and accessibility principles. If you follow this advice, your headings will be useful to all users in all contexts.</p>
		<h3 id="h1-at-top">Use one H1 at the top of the page</h3>
			<p>The H1 tag describes the main content of the page. It tells users what the page is about.</p>
			<p>If there is more than one H1 tag, users will be confused about which describes the purpose of the page.</p>
			<p>The H1 should always be at the start of the page's main content. It should be the first element after navigation. If important content comes before the H1, it will be unclear to users whether the H1 describes that content.</p>
			<p>As a rough guide, the only elements above the H1 should be those which are consistent across the entire site.</p>

		<h3 id="heading-levels-create-subsections">Heading levels create a layered hierarchy</h3>
			<p>A heading describes the content that comes after it, until the next heading of the same level.</p>
			<p>For example, an H2 describes all the content after it and before the next H2.</p>
			<p>In the example below, which content is described by the heading "Environment?</p>

		<section class="maria-example bad">
			<h2>Environment</h2>
			<h3>Geography</h3>
			<p>Maria Island takes the form of a figure-eight, with the northern section of the island significantly larger than the southern. Both parts of the island have quite rugged relief and they are joined by a tombolo about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) long known as McRaes Isthmus. The highest point, Mount Maria, is in the northern part of the island and stands 711 metres (2,333 ft) above sea level. Maria Island has been separated from nearby mainland Tasmania for some 3-4 thousand years.</p>
			<h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>
			<p>Fourteen distinct terrestrial plant communities occur on the island, which is mostly clothed in various forms of eucalypt forest. Natural and historical clearings provide grazing for many animals, such as bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus) which occur in high quantities on the island, and Tasmanian pademelons.</p>
			<h3>Access</h2>
			<p>A ferry sails multiple times a day from the town of Triabunna to the jetty in Darlington Bay at the northern end of Maria Island, a distance by sea of 16 km or nearly nine nautical miles. In winter, some sailings are subject to demand, while in summer extra sailings are provided.</p>
		</section>
		<p>How could you change this layout so the headings make sense?</p>
		<p>Try on <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/tichaelmurvey/pen/yLpXyKr">this CodePen (opens in new tab)</a>, then compare your solution to the one below.</p>

				<div class="solution" id="solution-q2">
		<p>In this example, the H2 "Environment" includes the H3 "Geography". The H2 "Flora and Fauna" creates a new content area, and contains the H3 "Access".</p>
		<p>All these headings accurately desribe the content that directly follows them. However, the level 2 headings contain content which doesn't match the heading text.</p>
		<p>You can see the way the headings divide up the content below.</p>

		<p>We can fix this by setting appropriate heading levels. Let's make <strong>Flora and Fauna</strong> a level 3 heading, and make <strong>Access</strong> a level 2 heading.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="segment color blue">
		<h3 id="dont-skip-heading-levels">Don't skip heading levels</h3>
			<p>All users, but especially users of assistive technology, expect headings to flow from H1 to H2 to H3 etc. If content skips a heading level, it can be confusing. Users may think they missed a heading level somewhere.</p>
			<p>Can you notice the problem with this example?</p>
			<section class="maria-example bad">
				<h2>History</h2>
				<h3>Industry and farming</h3>
				<p>Sealing was conducted on the island from at least 1805. Shore-based bay whaling was conducted in the 1830s and 1840s at four locations on the island: Darlington, Isle du Nord, Whalers Cove and Haunted Bay. In the 19th century, whaling ships sometimes anchored off shore and hunted for whales.</p>
					<h4>Bernacchi era</h4>
					<p>From the 1880s, the Italian entrepreneur Diego Bernacchi set up island enterprises, including silk and wine production and a cement factory, quarrying limestone deposits at the Fossil Cliffs for the raw material. A substantial cement works was built at Darlington in the early 1920s, with a 2 ft gauge tramway linking the quarries to the cement works and a new jetty.</p>
				<h3>National park</h3>
				<p>The Tasmanian Government resumed all of the island's freehold land and established the national park, proclaimed in 1972 and extended in 1991, to include part of the surrounding sea.</p>
				<h2>Environment</h2>
				<h4>Birds</h4>
				<p>Maria Island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant numbers of endangered swift parrots and forty-spotted pardalotes, over 1% of the world population of Pacific gulls, as well as populations of most of Tasmania's endemic bird species.</p>
			</section>
			<p>In this example, the level 4 heading "Birds" directly follows the level 2 heading "Environment".</p>
			<p>This increases cognitive load on all users, who will naturally expect a level 3 heading to follow the H2. Screen reader users may believe a heading has been marked up incorrectly or they somehow missed some content.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="segment">
		<h3 id="keep-hierarchy-shallow">Keep the hierarchy shallow if possible</h3>
			<p>Try to keep heading hierarchies to between 2 and 4 levels.</p>
			<p>Headings help users navigate the site, and are a big improvement on a wall of text. However, a heading structure with many levels can become confusing. Users need to hold in their head several different descriptions of the content they are currently viewing.</p>
			<p>More levels of heading often require headings to be styled with less visual clarity, in order to make each heading unique. This decreases the utility of headings.</p>
			<p>Usually, any content which uses level 5 and 6 headings can be flattened to use only H4s without losing much meaning.</p>
			<p>It's OK to have many headings of the same level one after another, as long as they are all related to the heading level above.</p>
			<p>Read the example below. What do you think about the heading structure?</p>

			<section class="maria-example bad">
				<h2>Environment</h2>
					<h3>Flora and fauna</h3>
						<h4>Flora</h4>
							<h5>Native flora</h5>
							<p>Fourteen distinct terrestrial plant communities occur on the island, which is mostly clothed in various forms of eucalypt forest.</p>
							<h5>Marine flora</h5>
							<p>The marine section of the national park protects a representative area of Tasmanian East Coast marine habitat, and has significantly larger individuals and populations of key marine species than surrounding waters.</p>
						<h4>Fauna</h4>
							<h5>Birds</h5>
							<p>Maria Island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant numbers of endangered swift parrots and forty-spotted pardalotes, over 1% of the world population of Pacific gulls, as well as populations of most of Tasmania's endemic bird species.</p>
							<h5>Tasmanian devils</h5>
							<p>In November 2012 captive Tasmanian devils were introduced to the island and are cared for by the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service staff who live on the island. These devils form part of the "insurance population" of devils unaffected by the devil facial tumour disease that is sweeping through mainland Tasmania's devil population.</p>
								<h6>Sightings</h6>
								<p>Tasmanian devils are sometimes seen by visitors.</p>
								<h6>Impact on penguins</h6>
								<p>There is some evidence that the devils are impacting on the bird life of the island. A population of little penguins that numbered 3,000 breeding pairs before the introduction has since disappeared completely from the island.</p>
			</section>
			<p><strong>This is confusing.</strong> With 6 levels of heading, it's hard to tell them apart, and it's hard to keep track of the hierarchy.</p>
			<p>How would you flatten the heading hierarchy?</p>
			<p>Try on <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/tichaelmurvey/pen/rNpwVQw">this CodePen (opens in new tab)</a>, then compare your solution to the one below.</p>


			<button id="show-solution-q3" onclick="showSolution('q3')" aria-expanded="false">Show solution</button>
			<div class="solution" id="solution-q3">
			<p>Let's start with the level 3 heading <strong>Flora and fauna</strong>, and the level 4 headings <strong>Flora</strong> and <strong>Fauna</strong>. These headings tell us the same information. You can remove one without losing any meaning.
			<p>The level 6 heading <strong>Sightings</strong> is not needed. The content it contains is described well enough by the H5. The content under the heading is so short, the user doesn't save any time by checking the heading. Let's remove that and fold the content in above.</p>
			<p>The final level 6 heading "Impact on penguins" is the most difficult to flatten. Here are two acceptable options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Remove the heading "Impact on penguins" and fold the content into the text above as a new paragraph.</li>
				<li>Create a heading "Little penguins" at the same level as "Tasmanian devils". Rephrase the content slightly so it does not implicitly rely on the context of the "Tasmanian Devils" heading.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We'll go for the second here because it's more challenging.</p>

			</section>
						<p>There are now three levels of heading. Each heading has a mangeable but significant amount of content inside it.</p>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="segment color blue">
	<h2 id="styles-should-match-hierarchy">Heading styles should match heading hierarchy</h2>
		<p>Heading tag levels show assistive technology users which headings describe which category. Heading styles should do the same for sighted users.</p>
		<h3 id="heading-size-should-scale">Heading size should scale with heading level</h3>
			<p>The H1 should be the largest heading on the page. Headings should decrease in size as the user enters sub-heading levels. For sighted users who do not use assistive technology, this is how they know which headings categorise which content.</p>
			<p>Some users can see the page, and use assistive technology to announce page content. If heading tag level and heading size are not consistent, these users will be confused.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="segment">

		<h3 id="indents-accents-fonts">Indents, accents and fonts can also show heading level</h3>
			<p>Size is the best way to communicate heading level. However, if sizes are too similar, there are other visual cues which can help users.</p>
			<h4>Indenting</h4>
			<p>You can indent content after each heading level, or after a certain heading level.</p>
			<p>This creates more obvious content categories and shows when a new section is beginning.</p>
			<p>Indenting every heading level can be overwhelming and is mainly used for highly technical documents where categorisation is critical.</p>
			<h4>Accents</h4>
			<p>Text decoration can distinguish a certain level of heading. Colour, underlines, and visual decoration like a left border can make a heading level unique.</p>
			<p>Here's an example using visual accents:</p>
		<section class="maria-example accent">
			<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
				<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
				<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
					<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
					<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
				<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
		</section>
		<p>Accents should <strong>never</strong> be the only visual indication of heading level, you should always use them to complement the heading size.</p>
		<h3 id="prioritise-content-structure">Prioritise consistent structure over consistent styles</h3>
			<p>Where possible, keep heading styling consistent across a site.</p>
			<p>There are situations where headings of the same level should be styled differently. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				
				<li>An "aside" might have a unique styling in a page. </li>
				<li>A purchase page or blog post page might need a different style for the page's main heading.</li>
			</ul> 
			<p>Sometimes, sites will apply the desired styling to a previously unused heading level, e.g. H5, and use it where you need the new style. This is confusing for people who use assistive technology, because it's completely outside of the content hierarchy.</p>
			<p>If you need an alternate heading style, <strong>keep the tag's heading level consistent</strong>, and use a class to apply a unique styling.</p>
